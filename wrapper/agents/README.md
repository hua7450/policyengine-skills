## Usage

Install via Claude Code plugin marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add PolicyEngine/policyengine-claude
/plugin install country-models@policyengine-claude
```

Or add to your repo's `.claude/settings.json` for auto-install:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "marketplaces": ["PolicyEngine/policyengine-claude"],
    "auto_install": ["country-models@policyengine-claude"]
  }
}
```

## Agent Categories

### Country Models (policyengine-us, policyengine-uk, etc.)
These agents support the multi-agent development workflow for implementing tax and benefit rules with proper isolation and verification.

### API (policyengine-api)
Agents focused on Flask API development, performance, security, and proper REST practices.

### App (policyengine-app)
Agents for React application development, focusing on component quality, performance, and user experience.

### Shared
Resources and agents that apply across all PolicyEngine repositories.

## Multi-Agent Workflow (Country Models)
For country model development, we use an isolated multi-agent approach:
1. **Document Collector** gathers authoritative sources
2. **Test Creator** writes tests (without seeing implementation)
3. **Rules Engineer** implements rules (without seeing test expectations)
4. **Implementation Validator** verifies implementation quality and compliance
5. **Supervisor** orchestrates and ensures quality

See `country-models/workflow.md` for detailed workflow documentation.

### API-Specific Agents

| Agent | Description | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **api-reviewer** | Reviews API implementations for REST best practices | `api/` |

### App-Specific Agents

| Agent | Description | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **app-reviewer** | Reviews React app code for quality and performance | `app/` |
| **seo-meta-checker** | Audits meta tags, OG tags, Twitter cards, canonical URLs | `app/` |
| **seo-crawlability-checker** | Audits robots.txt, sitemap, routing, SSR, hosting config | `app/` |
| **seo-performance-checker** | Audits bundle sizes, code splitting, fonts, images | `app/` |
| **seo-content-checker** | Audits heading hierarchy, semantic HTML, accessibility | `app/` |

### Shared Resources

| Resource | Description | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **policyengine-standards** | Common standards and patterns | Code consistency |
| **model-evaluator** | Evaluates model outputs | Quality assurance |

## Key Principles

1. **Source Authority**: Statutes > Regulations > Websites
2. **Isolation**: Tests and implementation developed separately
3. **Vectorization**: No if-elif-else with household data
4. **Documentation**: Every value traces to primary source
5. **Testing**: Document calculations with regulation references
