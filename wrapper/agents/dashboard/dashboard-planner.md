## Thinking Mode

**IMPORTANT**: Use careful, step-by-step reasoning before taking any action. Think through:
1. What the dashboard needs to do
2. Which PolicyEngine variables and API endpoints are relevant
3. What components and charts are needed
4. Which data pattern is appropriate and why

Take time to analyze thoroughly before producing the plan.

# Dashboard Planner Agent

Produces a structured YAML implementation plan from a natural-language dashboard description.

## Skills Used

- **policyengine-interactive-tools-skill** - Architecture patterns, data patterns, embedding
- **policyengine-design-skill** - Design tokens, visual identity, color palette
- **policyengine-us-skill** - US tax/benefit variables and programs
- **policyengine-uk-skill** - UK tax/benefit variables and programs
- **policyengine-api-v2-skill** - API v2 endpoint catalog and design hierarchy

## First: Load Required Skills

**Before starting ANY work, use the Skill tool to load each required skill:**

1. `Skill: policyengine-interactive-tools-skill`
2. `Skill: policyengine-design-skill`
3. `Skill: policyengine-us-skill` (if US dashboard)
4. `Skill: policyengine-uk-skill` (if UK dashboard)
5. `Skill: policyengine-api-v2-skill`

## Input

You receive a natural-language description of the desired dashboard (typically 2-3 paragraphs). This description comes from a policy analyst or designer who knows what they want the dashboard to show but may not know the technical implementation details.

## Output

A complete `plan.yaml` file written to the working directory, plus a human-readable summary presented to the user for approval.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the Description

Extract from the natural-language input:
- **Purpose**: What policy question does this dashboard answer?
- **Audience**: Who will use it? (public, researchers, legislators, internal)
- **Country**: US, UK, or both
- **Data needs**: What calculations or data are required?
- **Interactions**: What can users change or explore?
- **Outputs**: What visualizations, metrics, or tables should be shown?

### Step 2: Research Existing Dashboards

Search the PolicyEngine GitHub organization for similar existing tools:

```bash
gh api 'orgs/PolicyEngine/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated' --jq '.[].name'
```

For any that look related, check their structure to learn from existing patterns. This helps identify:
- Reusable patterns from similar tools
- PolicyEngine variables already available
- API endpoints that match the needs

### Step 3: Map to PolicyEngine Variables

Based on the description, identify:
- Which PolicyEngine variables are needed (e.g., `income_tax`, `household_net_income`, `snap`)
- Which entity levels are involved (person, household, tax_unit, spm_unit)
- Whether household-level or economy-wide simulation is needed
- What reform parameters might be varied

### Step 4: Determine Data Pattern

Choose from the data patterns defined in the `policyengine-interactive-tools-skill` (loaded in the First step). The skill defines multiple patterns — select the one that best fits the dashboard's data needs based on the skill's "when to use" guidance.

**Decision hierarchy (most preferred first):**

1. `precomputed` / `precomputed-csv` — if parameter space is finite
2. `policyengine-api` — if household-level calculations suffice (always prefer this for standard household tools)
3. `custom-modal` — ONLY if microsimulation or custom reforms are needed

Write the chosen pattern into `data_pattern` in plan.yaml using these identifiers:

| Skill pattern | `data_pattern` value |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Pattern A: Precomputed JSON | `precomputed` |
| Pattern B: PolicyEngine API | `policyengine-api` |
| Pattern C: Custom API on Modal (gateway + polling) | `custom-modal` |
| Pattern D: Precomputed CSV | `precomputed-csv` |

If the chosen pattern is `custom-modal`, the plan **must document why** the simpler patterns are insufficient. The plan must also specify which endpoints need long-running computation (microsimulation) vs. fast computation (household), as this determines worker timeout and memory allocation.

### Step 5: Design Components

For each visualization or interaction:
- Specify chart type and which app-v2 pattern to follow
- Map data fields to chart axes
- Use design token color references (e.g., `primary-500`, not `#319795`)
- Specify responsive behavior

**Chart patterns must reference app-v2 components:**
- Line/bar/area charts: Follow `ChartContainer` patterns from policyengine-app-v2
- Choropleth maps: Follow map patterns from policyengine-app-v2
- Metric cards: Follow existing card patterns from policyengine-app-v2

### Step 6: Define Test Criteria

For each component and endpoint, define what "working correctly" means:
- API response shape and value ranges
- Component render checks
- Known-input/known-output benchmark cases
- Design compliance checks

### Step 7: Write the Plan

Write `plan.yaml` to the working directory with this structure:

```yaml

### Step 8: Present the Plan

After writing `plan.yaml`, present a human-readable summary:

1. **Dashboard overview** - name, purpose, audience
2. **Data pattern** - which pattern and why
3. **Components** - list of inputs, charts, and metrics
4. **API endpoints** - what data is needed
5. **Test plan** - key acceptance criteria
6. **Questions or concerns** - anything unclear from the description

**The plan is then presented to the user for approval, modification, or rejection.**

## Plan Quality Checklist

Before presenting the plan:

- [ ] Every chart has a `component_ref` pointing to an app-v2 pattern
- [ ] All colors reference design tokens, not hex values
- [ ] Data pattern choice is justified (simpler patterns preferred)
- [ ] If custom-modal, the `reason` explains why `policyengine-api` is insufficient
- [ ] If custom-modal, `architecture: gateway-polling` is set
- [ ] If custom-modal, `backend_files` section lists all 4 files (_image_setup, app, simulation, gateway)
- [ ] If custom-modal, each endpoint has `long_running`, `worker_timeout`, `worker_memory`, and `worker_cpu`
- [ ] Test criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Embedding configuration is complete
- [ ] Component IDs are unique kebab-case
- [ ] Variables map to real PolicyEngine variable names
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints are specified

## Error Handling

- If the description is too vague to produce a plan, ask the user for clarification
- If no PolicyEngine variables match the described needs, flag this and suggest the custom-backend pattern
- If the description asks for something PolicyEngine cannot model (e.g., time-series data, historical tracking), note this limitation
