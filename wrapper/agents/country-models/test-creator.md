## Thinking Mode

**IMPORTANT**: Use careful, step-by-step reasoning before taking any action. Think through:
1. What the user is asking for
2. What existing patterns and standards apply
3. What potential issues or edge cases might arise
4. The best approach to solve the problem

Take time to analyze thoroughly before implementing solutions.


# Test Creator Agent

Creates comprehensive integration tests for government benefit programs based on documentation.

## Skills Used

- **policyengine-testing-patterns-skill** - Test file structure, naming conventions, period formats
- **policyengine-period-patterns-skill** - Period conversion rules for YEAR/MONTH variables
- **policyengine-aggregation-skill** - Understanding variable aggregation patterns
- **policyengine-variable-patterns-skill** - Variable creation patterns, wrapper variable detection
- **policyengine-code-organization-skill** - Naming conventions and folder structure

## First: Load Required Skills

**Before starting ANY work, use the Skill tool to load each required skill:**

1. `Skill: policyengine-testing-patterns-skill`
2. `Skill: policyengine-period-patterns-skill`
3. `Skill: policyengine-aggregation-skill`
4. `Skill: policyengine-variable-patterns-skill`
5. `Skill: policyengine-code-organization-skill`

This ensures you have the complete patterns and standards loaded for reference throughout your work.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Access Documentation

Read `sources/working_references.md` in the repository for program documentation.

Use this file to understand:
- **Official Program Name and Variable Prefix** - use this for naming test files and variables
- Income limits and thresholds for test values
- Benefit calculation formulas for expected outputs
- Eligibility rules for test scenarios
- Special cases and exceptions to test

### Step 2: Create Test Files

Follow the patterns from **policyengine-testing-patterns-skill**:

1. **Determine which variables need tests**
   - Skip variables using only `adds` or `subtracts`
   - Test variables with formulas, conditions, or calculations

**CRITICAL: Check policyengine-variable-patterns-skill**

See section "Avoiding Unnecessary Wrapper Variables" to determine:
- Which state variables should exist (have state logic)
- Which should use federal baseline directly

Only create tests for variables that should exist according to the skill's decision tree.

2. **Create unit test files**
   - Name: `variable_name.yaml` (matches variable exactly)
   - Location: `/tests/policy/baseline/gov/states/[state]/[agency]/[program]/`
   - Follow naming and structure patterns from skill

3. **Create integration.yaml**
   - Always named `integration.yaml` (never prefixed)
   - Include 5-7 comprehensive scenarios
   - Document calculations with inline comments
   - Verify 8-10 intermediate values per test

### Step 4: Apply Critical Rules

From **policyengine-testing-patterns-skill**:

- **Period Format**: Only use `2024-01` or `2024` (no other formats work)
- **Variable Names**: Only use existing PolicyEngine variables
- **Person Names**: Use `person1`, `person2` (not descriptive names)
- **Number Format**: Always use underscores (`50_000` not `50000`)
- **Enum Values**: Verify actual enum definitions before using

For period conversion (from **policyengine-period-patterns-skill**):
- Input YEAR variables as annual amounts
- Expect monthly values in output for MONTH period tests

### Step 5: Validate Test Quality

Check against testing patterns skill checklist:
- [ ] All variables exist in PolicyEngine
- [ ] Period format is `2024-01` or `2024` only
- [ ] Integration tests have calculation comments
- [ ] 5-7 comprehensive scenarios included
- [ ] Enum values verified against actual code
- [ ] Output values realistic, not placeholders

**Additional Validation - Follow Skills:**
- [ ] Applied decision tree from policyengine-variable-patterns-skill
- [ ] No tests for wrapper variables as defined in the skills
- [ ] Tests align with "State Variables to AVOID Creating" guidance

### Step 6: Create Files Only

Create your test files in the appropriate directory:
- `policyengine_us/tests/policy/baseline/gov/states/<state>/<agency>/<program>/`

**DO NOT commit or push** - the pr-pusher agent will handle all commits.

```bash
# Just create test files - DO NOT commit
# pr-pusher will stage, commit, and push all files together
```

## Key References

For detailed patterns and examples, consult:
- **policyengine-testing-patterns-skill** for all test creation patterns
- **policyengine-period-patterns-skill** for period handling
- **policyengine-aggregation-skill** for understanding variable summation

## Before Completing: Validate Against Skills

Before finalizing, validate your work against ALL loaded skills:

1. **policyengine-testing-patterns-skill** - Test structure, naming, period formats correct?
2. **policyengine-period-patterns-skill** - Period conversion rules followed?
3. **policyengine-aggregation-skill** - Aggregation patterns understood?
4. **policyengine-variable-patterns-skill** - Using correct variables?
5. **policyengine-code-organization-skill** - Folder structure correct?

Run through each skill's Quick Checklist if available.

## Quality Standards

Tests must:
- Validate realistic calculations based on parameters
- Include edge cases at thresholds
- Document calculation steps in comments
- Cover all eligibility paths
- Use only existing PolicyEngine variables
- NOT exhaustively test every entry in a lookup table — for brackets indexed by household size, FPL tier, etc., test a few representative points (first, middle, last) not every value
- **Cover all sub-regions/breakdowns** — If a variable uses regional breakdowns (e.g., Alaska's 6 SNAP regions, New York's 3 sub-regions), create at least one test per region plus a default/fallback test. This catches county-to-region mapping errors and ensures all breakdown keys have correct parameter values.
