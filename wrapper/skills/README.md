## Using Skills

Skills are automatically available in Claude Code and can be invoked when relevant tasks arise. They provide:

1. **Domain Knowledge**: Deep understanding of specific PolicyEngine components
2. **Code Patterns**: Best practices and common patterns for that area
3. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
4. **Examples**: Real-world usage examples from the codebase

## How Skills Work with Agents

Skills complement agents by providing:
- **Knowledge Base**: Skills contain domain expertise that agents reference
- **Agent Guidance**: Agents use skills for specific technical knowledge
- **Consistency**: Shared understanding across all agents

Example workflow:
1. Agent receives task requiring PolicyEngine knowledge
2. Agent consults relevant skill(s) for patterns and best practices
3. Agent implements solution following skill guidelines
4. Result aligns with PolicyEngine standards

## Contributing New Skills

   - `tools-and-apis/` for tool-specific skills
   - `data-science/` for data analysis skills
   - `documentation/` for standards and guides
   - `analysis/` for research methodologies

2. **Create the skill directory**: `skills/[category]/your-skill-name/`

3. **Add `SKILL.md`** (note: uppercase) with proper metadata header

4. **Follow the established structure** (For Users, For Analysts, For Contributors)

5. **Include practical examples** and troubleshooting guidance

6. **Update this README** to include your skill in the appropriate category table

7. **Update marketplace.json** to register the skill in appropriate plugins
